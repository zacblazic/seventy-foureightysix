# Model-View-Controller

* Model - an entity that the application operates on. These are usually persisted by some storage mechanism.
* View - what the users sees and interacts with (displays model data).
* Controller - handles requests by performing some operation with the model and returning the correct view of that model

## Separation of Concerns

The purpose of the MVC design pattern is to achieve a high separation of concerns resulting in loose coupling. This is done by reducing the dependencies between each of the MVC components.

This separation helps you manage complexity when you build an application, because it enables you to focus on one aspect of the implementation at a time.

The pattern specifies where each kind of logic should be located in the application.

The loose coupling between the three main components of an MVC application also promotes parallel development
