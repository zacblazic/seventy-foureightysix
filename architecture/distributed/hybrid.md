# On-Premises vs Off-Premises

On premises means that the application is on location, such as within a data center fully controlled by the client.

Off premises is the opposite, where the application is deployed to the "cloud", where the infrastructure is managed by an external company.

# Hybrid Cloud Solutions

Unlike ‘pure’ cloud solutions, hybrid solutions have a set of “on-premises” components: business processes, data stores, and services. These must be on-premises, possibly due to compliance or deployment restrictions. A hybrid solution is one which has parts of the solution deployed in the cloud while some applications remain deployed on-premises.
